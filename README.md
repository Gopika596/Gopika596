👋 Hi, I’m Gopika Sri

🎓 I’m a Computer Science and Engineering student at IARE with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics. My curiosity drives me to explore how intelligent systems can make a real-world impact.

💻 On the development side, I have hands-on experience with both MERN Stack and Java Full Stack Development, which allows me to build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications.

⚡ I enjoy combining my knowledge of software engineering with my passion for emerging technologies to create projects that push boundaries and solve problems in innovative ways.

🌱 Currently, I’m:

Diving deeper into AI/ML algorithms and their applications.

Experimenting with robotics projects that blend hardware and software.

Expanding my portfolio with full-stack projects that showcase real-world functionality.

🤝 I’m always open to collaborations, hackathons, and open-source contributions—working with others is one of the best ways to grow and learn.

📚 Beyond coding, I believe in continuous learning, sharing knowledge, and building a community around tech enthusiasm.
